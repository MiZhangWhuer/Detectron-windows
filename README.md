# Detectron-windows
   My compile caffe2&detectron on win7 platform. To use the compiled code on windows, please following the Getting Started part in the offical link https://github.com/MiZhangWhuer/Detectron/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md
    Notes, please unzip the file caffe2_pybind11_state_gpu.rar in Caffe2Python/caffe2/python/ path. Currently, there are still some issues for multi-gpu inferece and I will solve it later.
